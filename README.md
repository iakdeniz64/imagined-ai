Project Imagined.

A project where the use of OpenAI was the core objective.

A user can register, and login.
Then, there is a selection of 9 items (3 Movies, 3 TV Shows, 3 Anime).
Once a user chooses one of these, in a new page they can then generate an image generated by Dall-E from OpenAI, based on the chosen selection.
The user can then either copy the url from Dall-E (which is valid for 2 hours), or add it to their collection.
From their collection, the user can copy a permanent URL, download the picture to their device, or delete it from their collection.

The project is created as a Vite-React project. For CSS Styling, TailwindCSS is used. As a database, Neon is used as an online database, on the free tier. The images are uploaded to ImgBB.com, after being obtained from Dall-E.
